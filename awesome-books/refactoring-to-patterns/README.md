1. Por que escrevi o livro
+ 26 => 43 (17 páginas)

2. Refatoraçâo
+ 43 => 69 (26 páginas)
+ In this chapter I offer a few thoughts on what refactoring is and
what you need to do to be good at it. This chapter is best read
in accompaniment with the chapter "Principles in Refactoring"

3. Padrôes
+ 69 => 95 (26 páginas)
+ This chapter looks at what a pattern is; what it means to be
patterns happy; the importance of understanding that patterns
can be implemented in many ways; considerations for
refactoring to, towards, or away from patterns; whether or not
patterns make code more complex; what it means to have
"pattern knowledge"; and when it may make sense to do up-
front design with patterns.

4. Problemas de códgo (Code Smells)
+ 95 => 117 (22 páginas)

5. Um catalogo de rafotoraçao de padroes
+ 117 => 130 (13 páginas)
+ This chapter looks at the format of the refactorings in this book,
the projects referenced in the refactorings, the maturity level of
the refactorings, as well as a suggested study sequence for the
catalog. 




6. Criaçao
+ 130 => 247 (117 páginas)

7. Simplificaçao
+ 247 => 378 (131 páginas)

8. Genrealizaçao
+ 378 =>  517 (139 páginas)
+ Generalization is the transformation of specific code into
general-purpose code. The production of generalized code
frequently occurs as a result of refactoring. All seven
refactorings in this chapter yield generalized code. The most
common motivation for applying them is to remove duplicated
code. A secondary motivation is to simplify or clarify code.


9. Proteçao
+ 517 => 568 (51 páginas)
+ A refactoring that improves the protection of existing code must
do so in a way that doesn't alter the behavior of the existing
code. All three refactorings in this section do just that. Your
motivation for applying them may be to improve protection or it
may be a standard refactoring motivation, such as to reduce
duplication or to simplify or clarify code.

10. Acumulaçao
+ 568 => 612 (44 páginas)

11. Utiitarios
